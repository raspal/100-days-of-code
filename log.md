# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created my first tiny HTML/CSS project - CSS Blog.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't hard. Most of the time today went into learning Git/GitHub and then even more in trying to use GitHub. It kept giving one or other remote errors. Tried to use it through c9, GitHub's Desktop app, and with the Git SDK.
