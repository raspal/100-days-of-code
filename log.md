# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created my first tiny HTML/CSS project - CSS Blog.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't hard. Most of the time today went into learning Git/GitHub and then even more in trying to use GitHub. It kept giving one or other remote errors. Tried to use it through c9, GitHub's Desktop app, and with the Git SDK.

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created another CSS Blog, one with header image and right sidebar.

**Thoughts:** Don't want to clutter my GitHub page with small projects, so need to learn some other way, or put them into an organization. Will do that later. Till then, putting the projects on codepen.

### Day 3: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a page with divs and with a circle and line border.

**Thoughts:** Got some practice with divs and this is a cool looking border I saw on some website the other day.

### Day 4: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a colorful TicTacToe board which accepts input, using HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts:** Again, a simple but cool looking game, but can't store anything or decide or display the winner. Need some other technologies for that, will do it later someday.

### Day 5: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Colorful divs again. Looks like an IFTTT clone, but is just in HTML/CSS with the colorful boxes. Can be used for a services page.

**Thoughts:** Need to find or brainstorm some more ideas what to create the next few days.

### Day 6: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A simple photo gallery with my photos.

**Thoughts:** Didn't have much time today as I attended a WordPress meetup. So did this gallery, quickly.

### Day 7: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added thumbnails, corrected issue with non-displaying images, images now open in new tab.

**Thoughts:** All images after the 5th one weren't displaying on codepen, because I had used a local file: link. Have corrected those links, resized the images to thumbnail sizes, and changed the code on the html page. Also set to open the actual images in another tab. All images and thumbnails look okay now.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started coding my About page. Half text, half image.

**Thoughts:** For some reason, my image won't display full/100% height. Have to fix this.

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created the template to use for the tribute page project. Colorful

**Thoughts:** Struggled to put two divs side by sude such that the image and text take up different percentage of the box size. Then, stubled upon someone doing this without the divs. I used the same method inside divs. Problem solved. This will later serve as the template for creating the tribute page.

### Day 10: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a 99% clone of UK website's Homepage. Will refine later.

**Thoughts:** Had to struggle for a while to make the page look almost alike the UK homepage. There's still some extra spacing under the main list items in the left sidebar.

### Day 11: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Only created Part of my portfolio page, today.

**Thoughts:** Creating and customizing the menu took a lot of time as I had to play with what selectors to target. Okay for now. Will add more to this page later someday.

### Day 12: January 14, 2017

**Thoughts:** Couldn't tweet or update log yesterday, though had worked quite a few hours on my portfolio page.

### Day 13: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued updating my portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** Added a few more sections, played with some cool looking colors and shades. Experimented with a few other things to add. Have added the repo to GitHub. This becomes my first working repo on GitHub, though not really the first project I started with. Will add the other projects I've done, later, from codepen.

### Day 15: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added to the blog and portfolio sections of my portfolio.

**Thoughts:** Added placeholder blog posts, three of my projects in the portfolio section, and tidied the CSS. I'm also putting my code in codepen, because people can't view/run my code from github repos unless they download it. Codepen is a hassle if there are images in the project, I had to upload them using ftp, to my webhost. Dropbox links didn't work. All this took like a good 4 hours.

### Day 16: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a bottom navbar and a footer.

**Thoughts:** Added a bottom navbar and a footer with lots of placeholder links. Still need to remove an unwanted whitespace between the two, and make the page responsive and proper full width.

### Day 17: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Mostly, coded on two private pages having Hindi content.
