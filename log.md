# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created my first tiny HTML/CSS project - CSS Blog.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't hard. Most of the time today went into learning Git/GitHub and then even more in trying to use GitHub. It kept giving one or other remote errors. Tried to use it through c9, GitHub's Desktop app, and with the Git SDK.

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created another CSS Blog, one with header image and right sidebar.

**Thoughts:** Don't want to clutter my GitHub page with small projects, so need to learn some other way, or put them into an organization. Will do that later. Till then, putting the projects on codepen.

### Day 3: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a page with divs and with a circle and line border.

**Thoughts:** Got some practice with divs and this is a cool looking border I saw on some website the other day.

### Day 4: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a colorful TicTacToe board which accepts input, using HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts:** Again, a simple but cool looking game, but can't store anything or decide or display the winner. Need some other technologies for that, will do it later someday.

### Day 5: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Colorful divs again. Looks like an IFTTT clone, but is just in HTML/CSS with the colorful boxes. Can be used for a services page.

**Thoughts:** Need to find or brainstorm some more ideas what to create the next few days.

### Day 6: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A simple photo gallery with my photos.

**Thoughts:** Didn't have much time today as I attended a WordPress meetup. So did this gallery, quickly.

### Day 7: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added thumbnails, corrected issue with non-displaying images, images now open in new tab.

**Thoughts:** All images after the 5th one weren't displaying on codepen, because I had used a local file: link. Have corrected those links, resized the images to thumbnail sizes, and changed the code on the html page. Also set to open the actual images in another tab. All images and thumbnails look okay now.
